        Welcome to my pages, in here trying to paint a picture from myself and what I am all about. In here you can see my work history, competences and other details. 
        Hopefully you find time to discuss, how I can contribute with your success story.<p></p>Note that if you do not want to hire me for permanent bases, I can be hired for 
        the shorter periods, for the companies at minimum for the one month and for the individuals for the day !
